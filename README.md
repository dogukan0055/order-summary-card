## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

```html
Usage of main and article and footer tags. Their semantic meanings.
```

```css
.card_link {
    margin-inline-start: auto;
}

I like this css code because using this helped me arrange position of the item.

main {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    margin: 4rem auto;
}

This one is my fav also. It's because made it possible to center it and give some space around it.
```

### Continued development

I'm still working on flexbox and positionings items on a site. Because I'm not very happy with the result, still there's a way to go.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://flexbox-guide.vercel.app/) - This site is really handy when you can't figure flexbox out.
